Design Choices
  - I tried to keep the overall application fairly simple, using a mix of the react framework along with bootstrap to help 
    with the design. 
  - The overall application consists of two components. The first being the HomePage compentent which shows the search bar 
    as well as results if there are any to be displayed. The results are populated by taking the value from the search bar 
    and using that to pull data from the API.
  - When a beer is clicked, the second component, BeerDescription displays all details pertaining that beer.
  - Also, I included a back button to return to the home page in case you would like to search for another beer.
